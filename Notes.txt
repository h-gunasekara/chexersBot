Where we are going wrong:

  Thy tree doesn't explore all options it just goes down the left most branch. should be an easy fix since all I need to do is change a condition in the recursion.

  propagating the heuristic up



Monte Carlo - go down a fair few random branches and get probabilities on what works.
Pruning

Worth hard coding your first few moves



It looks like we might have to cut our loses and spend our time focusing on a good heuristic for our minimax and if we get the chance then making marginal improvements to our minimax algorithm. We aren't in a state where we can be testing new algorithms. we are better off getting creative with our heuristic and winning marks there.
